# Portfolio Website

## Premise: 
To create a website that displays information about me as vCard to help in job search and display work.

## Build with: 

Asp .Net Core, front using bootstrap 4, font-awesome and whatever might be needed.

## Must have functionality:

* Landing page with main information display and “download resume”.
* Linkedin, Twitter, GitHub icons for quick nav.
* Display bookkeep project.
* A openWeatherAPI page with specification and project.
* A easy to use contact form - just to db.

## Nice to have:

* Login functionality for blog.
* Information from Pluralsight, including role Iq.
* Completed courses with actual links.
* Weather API functions like check weather of spec city, or use a map.
* Other API used, like pluralsight to display some info.
* Some esport ladder API, maybe blizzard with wrapper.
